# Git_Learning_Series

First Github Repository..
Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development.It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.

The name "git" was given by Linus Torvalds when he wrote the very first version. He described the tool as "the stupid content tracker" and the name as (depending on your way):

random three-letter combination that is pronounceable, and not actually used by any common UNIX command. The fact that it is a mispronunciation of "get" may or may not be relevant. stupid. contemptible and despicable. simple. Take your pick from the dictionary of slang. "global information tracker": you're in a good mood, and it actually works for you. Angels sing, and a light suddenly fills the room. "goddamn idiotic truckload of sh*t": when it breaks

The following git commands:-

git init command: git init [repository name]

git clone command: git clone [url]

git add command: git add [file]

git commit command: git commit -m “[ Type in the commit message]”
